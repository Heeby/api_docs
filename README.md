We welcome any suggestions for how we can improve our documentation. In order to suggest a change:

* Fork the repo.
* Open an issue describing what changes you would like to make.
* To add an example language, add your language to the "language_tabs" in index.md, then go through and add each example below the existing javascript example.
* To edit some of the existing examples, edit the source/includes/[_websocket.md | _rest.md | _introduction.md].
* Once you have edited the source files, you should preview them locally.
* Once you are content with your edits, submit a Pull Request using clear commit messages and referencing the issue that you opened.
* We will review the Pull Requests, and if accepted, we will merge the changes in and then publish the new docs and mark the issue as resolved.

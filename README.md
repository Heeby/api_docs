We welcome any suggestions for how we can improve our documentation. In order to suggest a change:

* Fork the repo
* To add an example language, add your language to the "language_tabs" in index.md, then go through and add the examples directly below each of the javascript examples (see slate documentation below)
* To edit some of the existing examples, edit the source/includes/[_websocket.md | _rest.md | _introduction.md]
* Once you have edited the source files, you should preview them locally
* Once you are content with your edits, submit a Pull Request
* We will review the Pull Requests, and if accepted, we will merge the changes in and then publish the new docs

We are using Slate, More information is available here https://github.com/tripit/slate
